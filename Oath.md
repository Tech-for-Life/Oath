# Hippocratic Oath for Scientists & Technologists

I swear to all the builders, inventors, philosophers, and artisans that have come before me, ancient and present, who diligently crafted our collective 
and shared body of scientific discovery, knowledge, and tools, making them my witnesses, that I will carry out, according to my ability and judgment, 
this oath and this indenture.

To hold my teacher in this art equal to my own parents; to make them partner in my livelihood; when they are in need of money to share mine with them; 
to consider their family as my own, and to teach them this art, if they want to learn it, without prejudice or indenture; to impart precept, oral instruction, 
and all other instruction to my own children, the children of my teacher, to indentured pupils who have taken the technologist’s oath, and to those who 
seek illumination from the darkness of ignorance and the demons of superstition.

I will use science and it’s technologies to help the world and its denizens, especially those that require assistance or protection, according to my ability
and judgment, but never with a view to injury and wrong-doing. Neither will I administer a technology to directly cause harm or injury when asked to do so, 
nor will I suggest such a course. Similarly I will not give to anyone knowledge of such capability to cause harm or injury. But I will keep pure and sacred 
both my knowledge and my practice. I will not use technology, it’s inventions or devices, not even, verily, on sufferers from antiquated vestiges without 
consent, but I will give place to such as are craftsmen therein.

Into whatsoever field and place of practice I enter, I will enter to help this world and other worlds, and I will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing 
and harm, especially from abusing of living bodies and land, bonded or free. And whatsoever I shall see or hear in the course of my profession, as well as 
outside my profession in my shared exchanges, if it be what should not be published or practiced, I will never divulge, share, contribute, or enable such 
things to be.

Now if I carry out this oath, and break it not, may I gain forever reputation among all humanity for my life and for my art; but if I break it and 
forswear myself, may the opposite befall me.
