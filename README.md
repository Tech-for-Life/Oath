Hippocratic Oath for Scientists &amp; Technologists

The Hippocratic Oath for Scientists &amp; Technologists is an oath of ethics taken by scientists and technologists. It's aim is to be the defacto oath of a practitioner, especially in the realm of AI, machine learning, physical sciences, and robotics. 

## Overview

In its current form, the oath requires a new scientist or technologist to swear to uphold specific ethical and moral standards. The oath is an expression of technological ethics, establishing several universal principles of science and technology ethics which do not have a guiding singular set of principles of 'do-no-harm' today. These include the principles of non-maleficence, and non-proliferation. Swearing a modified form of the original Hippocratic oath must be a rite of passage for science and technology graduates worldwide, and may one day be a requirement enshrined in legal statutes of various jurisdictions much like the medical profession, such that violations of the oath may carry criminal or other liability beyond the oath's symbolic nature.
